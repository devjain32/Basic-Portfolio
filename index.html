            Hi! My name is Dev Jain and I am currently a student at UT Austin. I am originally from Houston, Texas. I am majoring in Mechanical Engineering and Economics. I just finished my freshman year, and decided to do a coding bootcamp over the summer to learn more about coding and web development.
            After I graduate from this coding bootcamp, I'd like to create my own websites and help out organizations on campus with their publicity. Also, during my next three years at UT, I'd like to work on my own start-ups and put effort into helping more people in the world so I 
            can make a difference with what I learn. Outside of classes, I like to watch a lot of TV, play guitar, and read. This summer, in addition to the boot camp, I hope to read a lot of books and spend some time having fun before the school year starts back up again!
